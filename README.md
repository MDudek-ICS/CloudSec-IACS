## IACS High-Level Risk Assessment for Cloud Products and Services

Current Version: CutSec_IACS_Cloud_Assessments_v1.0.pdf

The introduction of a cloud service into an industrial / automation control environment requires a [Cyber Security Management System (CSMS)](https://www.isa.org/products/isa-62443-2-1-2009-security-for-industrial-automat)  to manage risk by creating policies and procedures, assignment of organization responsibilities, planning and implementation of awareness training, and selection of countermeasures to be implemented by the owner / operator. The CSMS initial high-level risk assessment requires gathering information about the cloud service, some of which must be provided by the product / service provider. This information will allow the owner / operator to confirm the Capability Security Level (SL-C) components that are implemented and maintained by the product / service provider. This information will initiate the CSMS process and provide the starting point for a detailed risk assessment using the [Cloud Security Maturity Model](https://www.iansresearch.com/resources/cloud-security-maturity-model).
